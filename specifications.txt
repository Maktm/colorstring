colorstring Specifications v1

colorstring is a Python3 library that provides the ability to write colored text
using a small domain-specific language (DSL). This document describes the syntax
for the DSL.

Format:

    Text colored using the colorstring DSL all use the same format of:

        ^\[[reset][s][effect][s]f[fgcolor][s]b[bgcolor][s]\]

    When using the format, the order in which you use the different specifiers
    makes all the difference. Using the wrong order will likely cause you to
    come across a malformed string.

Specifiers:

    All specifiers begin with the caret symbol (^) and must be ordered using the
    same ordering as the format specified above.

    Reset: The reset specifier is used to reset either the foreground, background,
    or both the foreground and background. Resetting the foreground or background
    simply removes any effects (bold, underline, italics) and sets the foreground
    color and background color to their current, default equivalents.

        ^.      Reset foreground color
        ^,      Reset background color
        ^:      Reset foreground and background

    TODO: It is possible to choose different foreground and background colors as the
     default if you don't like the ones provided by colorstring.

    Effects: Besides changing the foreground and background colors, you may also
    add effects including bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough.

        ^n      Sets the font style to normal
        ^B      Sets the font style to bold
        ^u      Sets the font style to underline
        ^y      Sets the font style to no underline
        ^S      Sets the font style to strikethrough
        ^t      Sets the font style to no strikethrough
        ^i      Sets the font style to italic
        ^o      Sets the font style to no italic

    Foreground colors: Depending on the terminal in use, colorstring can provide
    up to 256 colors for the foreground and background. The basic syntax for foreground
    colors is as follows:

        ^f[fgcolor]

    [fgcolor] can be replaced by any number between 0-7, 0-127, and 0-255 for
    8-color, 128-color, and 256-color supported terminals, respectively.
    Here are some examples:

        ^f12        Sets the foreground color to 12
        ^f128       Sets the foreground color to 128 on a terminal with 256 colors

    TODO: When using colors out of the range supported by the terminal you are using,
     the foreground color specifiers are simply substituted with empty strings.
     This way, you don't get the specifier printed as a string or included for no
     reason when it adds no value.

    Background colors: Besides the fact that background colors use a slight different
    syntax than foreground colors, they are identical in every other aspect but as
    the background color equivalent. The syntax is as follows:

        ^b[bgcolor]

    Span: These are used in combination with all the 4 specifiers available (reset,
    effect, fgcolor, and bgcolor) to create a range of characters or words where the
    specifier being used should be applied over. This eliminates the need to have to
    use a specifier then undo it after a certain number of characters/words. A span
    takes the format of:

        *[s] or *[s]w or **

    The former syntax is used to create a span over a specific number of characters
    while the latter is used to create a span over a specific number of words. Both
    syntaxes should replace [s] with a positive, non-zero integer.
    Using the last syntax will place a sets at the very end of the string. This means
    that once the string is printed, everything is reset for the next string to print.

    TODO: When using the latter syntax, a word is everything that comes before a space.
